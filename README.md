# Vue-lit
Proof of concept mini custom elements framework powered by @vue/reactivity and lit-html. The "framework" itself is just ~70 lines of code and the two libraries weigh in at ~6kb min + brotli combined.

The API is almost identical to Vue Composition API, but defines native custom elements underneath.
